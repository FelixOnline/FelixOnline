        <h3>Commenting Policy</h3> 
        <p>Felix is fully supportive of fierce and frank discussions. We will generally allow comments that are on-topic and avoid personal attacks; criticising a someone's decisions is allowed, criticising their weight, for example, is not.</p>
        <p>Comments may be deleted/rejected if they:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>are off-topic</li>
            <li>contain ad-hominem attacks</li>
            <li>are potentially libellous</li>
            <li>use excessively foul language</li>
            <li>are obviously spam</li>
        </ul>
