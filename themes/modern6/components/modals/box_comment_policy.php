	<h1>Commenting Policy</h1> 
	<p>Felix is fully supportive of fierce and frank discussions. We will generally allow comments that are on-topic and avoid personal attacks; criticising someone's decision is allowed, criticising their weight, for example, is not.</p>
	<p>Comments may be deleted/rejected if they:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>are off-topic</li>
		<li>contain ad-hominem attacks</li>
		<li>are potentially libellous</li>
		<li>use excessively foul language</li>
		<li>are obviously spam</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We do not modify comments, however we do reserve the right to remove them from our website.</p>
	<p>Your IP address will be submitted to <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> for spam detection purposes. You may also be required to validate your email by clicking a link in an email we send you.</p>
