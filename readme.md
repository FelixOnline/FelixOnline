#Felix Online
Welcome to the Felix Online source code! This is the code that powers the [Felix Online](http://felixonline.co.uk) website. Completely custom built and a bit messy!

Contributors welcome! Just fork the repository and send us a pull request with your changes. 

Maintained by Jonathan Kim (jk708@imperial.ac.uk) and Chris Birkett

## Getting started:
###Requirements:
    * Local LAMP stack (Apache, PHP and MySQL)
    * [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
Have a look a our [installation guide](wiki/Installation) if you are unsure how to get the above. 

###Setup:
    * Clone the repo into the folder your local web server hosts from
    * Import media\_felix.sql into your MySql database
    * Make your own config.inc.php to connect to your local database and change default links. There is a config.sample.php in the inc/ folder so use that as a base.
    * Go to local site (e.g. http://localhost/felix/)
